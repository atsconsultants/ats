      <p>CatholicCare Diocese of Wollongong has had the privilege of working with ATS as a trusted partner for over a decade. 
        The mission of ATS is encapsulated in their name - assisting not for profit community organisations to succeed.
        </p>
        
        <p>The ATS team are highly experienced professionals from diverse corporate backgrounds inspired by a shared commitment 
        to bringing this mission to life in the community. &nbsp;Such is their commitment that all the services provided by ATS are 
        generously offered on a strict pro bono basis, while operating with all the professionalism of a private consultancy firm.<br>
      </p>
      
      <p>We have found the approach of the ATS team to be highly ethical and mission aligned. 
        &nbsp;They invite fresh thinking and approaches around strategy, offer project management guidance and coaching, 
        help improve discipline with strategy execution, and at times take the role of a trusted 'critical friend' 
        to help us stretch and grow our vision of what is possible. 
        &nbsp;Throughout their engagement with us on a different projects, we have found them to be consistently respectful in approach, 
        and always seeking opportunities for mutual learning to take place. 
      </p>
      
      <p>The partnership with ATS has been invaluable, and we look forward very much to continuing our relationship 
        with them into the future.

        <p>ATS provided outstanding support to CatholicCare Broken Bay across a number of key projects. &nbsp;
          The hallmarks of their work provide great value to those fortunate enough to receive their services and include:
        </p>
          
            <ul>
              
            <li><p>Extraordinary breadth and depth of expertise  and capability across a number of strategic disciplines 
              that would otherwise be inaccessible to most NFPs</p></li>
            <li><p>A professional, business perspective coupled with a real commitment to understanding 
                and enhancing the value of NFP agencies in our communities</p></li>
            <li><p>Capacity to help organisations simplify what might otherwise be very complex processes, 
                recognising the need for frontline staff to engage, and feel confident</p></li>
            <li><p>Evidenced-based and comprehensive project management methodology which facilitates capacity 
                building and continuous improvement with the organisation</p></li>
            <li><p>Consultants who, in spite of their stellar careers, are humble, 
                empathetic and driven by a desire to help NFPs reach their full potential,
                recognising the significant regulatory and financial constraints that are a reality of NFP 
                governance and management</p></li>
              
        </ul>
        
          
          <p>Working with ATS was not just an enabler of projects for CatholicCare Broken Bay, 
            but a great opportunity for learning about the value of collaboration. 
          </p>
          <p>I would recommend ATS to any NFP organisation that has a challenge to address, 
            confident that the support provided by ATS will prove to be valuable.
